# Train-Brain-Game

Train Brain is a great board game that will improve your strategic and tactical thinking.

This game is very similar to chess and is an excellent board logic game that can boost your brainpower and cognitive thinking.

The game is played on an 8Ã—8 chessboard with two players. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces have been randomly shuffled on each player's back rank. This will minimize the impact of Theory/Opening in a match. The objective of the game is to capture the enemy king.
